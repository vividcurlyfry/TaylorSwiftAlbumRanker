This is a .NET 8.0.204, Blazor Server Side program with a SQL Express database.
To run this program:
1. Change the appsettings.json Data Source to match a SQL Express data source on the local machine.
2. Open the Package Manager Console and enter "dotnet ef migrations add Tables"
3. In the PCM, enter "dotnet ef database update" 
4. I'm not sure how to run a blazor app from the command line as "dotnet run" throws a lot of errors. Pressing F5 is what works! xD
